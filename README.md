# GravitativeCableCar
Gravitative Cable Car mod for Cities Skylines.

This mod was written in the prefix method of Harmony so it can be incompatible with other mods which also change how cable cars are rendered. Right now this is just a proof-of-concept thing so I don't plan to spend too much time on it. I'll rewrite it using the transpiler method when I have more time and a known incompatibility with another mod occurs.

This is not my main Github account so you probably would get a faster response if you send me a Steam message
